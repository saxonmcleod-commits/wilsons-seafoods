**Subject:** [Client Name] + [Your Business Name]: A Digital Upgrade?

Hi [Client Name],

I'm a local developer and I've been a fan of [Client Business Name] for a while. I noticed that your current website [mention specific pain point, e.g., isn't mobile-friendly / is hard to find on Google / doesn't show your latest menu].

I specialize in building **high-performance, custom websites** for small businesses that don't just look good—they save you time.

**What I can build for you:**
*   **Custom Admin Panel:** Update your own hours, menu, and specials from your phone in seconds. No more calling a web guy for small changes.
*   **Lightning Fast:** A site that loads instantly, keeping customers happy and Google happy (better SEO).
*   **Premium Design:** A look that matches the quality of your [product/service].

I recently built a similar system for **Wilson's Seafoods** (see case study attached), and it's saved them hours of admin work every week.

I'd love to buy you a coffee and show you a quick demo of what a modern site could do for [Client Business Name]. Are you free for 15 mins next [Day of Week]?

Best,

Saxon
